## Use Case

In any website that has users with different levels of capabilities (e.g. viewers vs editors) or that holds confidential information for users, it’s important that the site protects these features and/or this data from people who don’t have permission to use these features and/or interact with this data.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, practitioners should be able to do the following:

- Understand common types of authorization vulnerabilities
- Understand the potential impacts of those types of vulnerabilities
- Understand the mechanisms by which those vulnerabilities work
- Understand, in broad strokes, how those vulnerabilities can be prevented

## Main Section
### Foundation Knowledge

Authorization is the process of making sure that a user of a system has permission to perform an action or create/read/edit/delete a piece of data in that system, and preventing these actions if the user doesn’t have permission. Generally, these are the simplest types of security controls to implement, and the simplest type of vulnerability to find. However, even though they are conceptually simple, both securing and breaking the controls are generally very tedious and error-prone.

Every time a web application loads an access-controlled page or performs an access-controlled action, it must first verify that the current user has successfully authenticated, and then verify that the user has the right permissions. Generally, authorization logic is highly application-specific, so web frameworks provide limited support for this, so authorization logic needs to be manually added to each page. Sometimes it’s implemented in the page logic, sometimes it’s implemented in the APIs that web pages call internally. In any case, if it’s missing, then unauthorized users can do things that they are not supposed to be able to do.

To ease communication about vulnerabilities, authorization vulnerabilities are generally broken down into three categories.

### Missing authentication

Sometimes developers will fail to even check that a user is logged in on a page or set of pages. Any user on the internet can view the post-authentication pages or perform post-authentication actions. This class of vulnerability has sometimes been called “forced browsing” or “direct object reference.” There are several ways this kind of vulnerability manifests.

One pattern for this vulnerability is that a site will show one set of links to users who haven’t logged in, and another set of links to users who have logged in. However, no pages that show user-specific data or perform actions actually check that the user is logged in.

Another common pattern is that pages that render data in the browser have authentication checks, but the pages that merely process data (e.g. via a HTTP POST) don’t. This is generally caused by developers not having a deep understanding of how the web works and not realizing that it’s quite easy to generate arbitrary HTTP requests. With this pattern, users can generally only see data that they’re authorized to see, but can perform any action on the site, and modify other users’ data. Note that since users can see and modify their own data, it’s very easy for attackers with an account to discover the missing authentication.

A third common pattern is that individual pages or actions, or perhaps sections of the site, will just fail to check for authentication. Generally this is a result of developer oversight.

### Vertical Privilege Escalation

Vertical privilege escalation happens when less powerful users can perform more powerful actions on the website. This is commonly caused by the site checking authentication status but fails to check permissions. It was mentioned above that frameworks generally don’t include built-in functions for authorization, but many perform checks for authentication. If a page (or entire site) properly performs authentication checks but does not perform permissions checks, this usually results in vertical privilege escalation.

An example of vertical privilege escalation might be in an online forum that has both regular users and moderators. When regular users log in, they can create posts and edit their own posts. When moderators log in, they can also create posts and edit their own posts, but can also hide other users posts and ban users. If regular users can edit the URL or change form parameters to also hide user posts or ban users, that would be vertical privilege escalation.

The patterns that lead to vertical privilege escalation are essentially the same as those that lead to missing authentication, except that users must be logged in.

#### Try it yourself!

Log into your DVWA and make sure the security level is set to low and that you are signed in as the admin (it’s best to log out and log back in using the credentials “admin:password”. Navigate to the “Authorisation Bypass” page. If you cannot see this page in the left bar and have the most up to date version of DVWA, it means that you are not logged in as the admin.

After that, open a private browsing window or another browser and log into your DVWA as the “gordonb” user and note that the Authorisation Bypass does not appear in gordonb’s navigation bar. Can you figure out how to access the Authorisation Bypass as gordonb? (If you're having trouble, remember that authorization vulnerabilities are generally very straightforward. Don’t overthink it.)

### Horizontal Privilege Escalation

Horizontal privilege escalation happens when users can view or perform actions on other users’ data, when those other users have the same access level.

An example of horizontal privilege escalation might be in the above online forum. If a regular user can edit other users’ posts, that would be horizontal privilege escalation.

With horizontal privilege escalation, there are three major development patterns that lead to the vulnerability. The first is that pages check that users are logged in and that they have the right access level, but completely fail to check data-level permissions. Typically this will result in the entire site, or an entire section of the site, being vulnerable. The second is that individual pages or actions fail to check data-level permissions due to developer oversight. Finally, occasionally websites will pass the user id in a URL parameter or hidden form field, instead of reading it from the server side session. The end-user can easily modify these parameters, usually resulting in privilege escalation.

Preventing Authorization Vulnerabilities

As noted above, the two root causes for authorization vulnerabilities tend to be lack of developer awareness (hence entire sites or site sections missing the proper controls) or lack of consistency in implementing controls. Since framework support is generally poor, developers often need to implement their own controls from scratch. Here are a few tips to consider:

- Attempt to layer and simplify the process of checking user permissions. To the extent that your framework has functions to support authorization, use them. Consistent functions to check user authorization are less error prone than complex logic.
- For extremely powerful users, consider using a separate website entirely. For example, www.example.com for regular users, and admin.example.com for administrative users.
- For data-level permissions checks, having consistent developer guidelines can reduce errors. For instance, a rule that all data access must go through API calls, every API function must include a user id parameter, and every API that takes a user ID must use it in database calls. Having consistent rules like this makes it easier to avoid, and to find, authorization errors.

### Exercise 3 (optional, only for those comfortable with basic python): code bug finding challenge

The code simulates a vulnerable web application with a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the delete_profile function only checks for the current user's write permission but does not verify that the current user is authorized to delete other users' profiles. This allows any user with write permission to delete any other user's profile, regardless of their own permissions.

{{< highlight python >}}
# Import statement for print function (Python 3.x)
from __future__ import print_function

# User data (replace with your own test data)
users = {
    "admin": {"id": 1, "username": "admin", "permissions": ["read", "write", "delete"]},
    "user1": {"id": 2, "username": "user1", "permissions": ["read", "write"]},
    "user2": {"id": 3, "username": "user2", "permissions": ["read", "write"]},
}

# Function to simulate fetching a user's profile
def get_profile(username):
    if username not in users:
        return None
    return users[username]

# Function to simulate deleting a user's profile (vulnerable)
def delete_profile(username, current_user):
    if "write" in current_user["permissions"]:
        if username in users:
            del users[username]
            return f"User '{username}' deleted successfully."
        else:
            return f"User '{username}' not found."
    else:
        return "Permission denied: You do not have permission to delete users."

# Test cases (modify as needed)
current_user = users["user1"]  # Simulate a user with write permission
target_username = "user2"  # Simulate the target user

# Try to delete the victim's profile
result = delete_profile(target_username, current_user)

# Print the result (expected output: "Permission denied: You do not have permission to delete users.")
print(result)
{{< / highlight >}}

**Find and fix the vulnerability in the `delete_profile` function.**

#### Answer key and explanation

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `delete_profile` function only checks for the current user's write permission but does not verify that the current user is authorized to delete other users' profiles. This allows any user with write permission to delete any other user's profile, regardless of their own permissions.

**To fix the vulnerability, you could:**

1. Check if the current user has the "delete" permission specifically.
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict deletion based on user roles.
3. Add additional checks to verify the legitimacy of the deletion request.
