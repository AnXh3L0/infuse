## Use Case

One way or another, every web application accepts and processes untrusted input. This input usually comes from end users and their browsers but may also come from other websites or backend systems. Depending on where this information flows, the processing of the data may have undesirable effects on the website or its users.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, practitioners will be able to find ways that the format or structure of the data sent to a website may expose and exploit vulnerabilities.

They should also be able to find and exploit the following types of data validation vulnerabilities:

- Cross-site scripting
- SQL injection
- Path traversal
- Command Injection
- Server-side request forgery
- XXE injection
- NoSQL injection

## Main Section
### What are data validation vulnerabilities?

As you may remember from the Web Application Security Fundamentals learning path, data validation vulnerabilities can take many forms. In web applications, they are commonly triggered by the presence of certain characters when data is interpreted in a changing context. For example, the characters &lt; or > may be harmless in an application’s code, but can trigger a cross-site scripting vulnerability when put into a web page. The single-quote or space characters may be harmless in a web page or application’s code, but can trigger a SQL injection vulnerability when included in a database query. Generally, for every system involved in a web application (HTML, JavaScript, SQL, filesystems, unix shell, etc) there’s a different type of possible data validation vulnerability.

#### Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-site scripting (usually referred to as XSS) is generally the easiest type of data validation vulnerability to engage with. The inputs and outputs are visible to the tester, and it only requires knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. It is also extremely common, [being found on 1 in 5 websites tested by a major website assessment company](https://venturebeat.com/security/report-50-of-all-web-applications-were-vulnerable-to-attacks-in-2021/). As such, that’s where we’ll be starting.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy XSS topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) and complete the reading and labs.

##### Effective XSS testing

The common thing people do for XSS testing is to put something like `">&lt;script>alert('xss')&lt;/script>` into different request parameters, and wait for a JavaScript pop-up when the page comes back. There are two problems with this.

The first problem is that in a site that has a lot of stored XSS vulnerabilities, you may end up clicking away multiple JavaScript popups on every page you visit. This is annoying, distracting, and will significantly slow down your testing.

The second problem is that if you use the same string for each input, you won’t immediately know what inputs correspond to what outputs. If you have a stored XSS that appears in multiple parts of the site, you may stumble upon your XSS test string somewhere on the site, but not know where it came from.

Instead, you can do something a bit more subtle and informative. One approach is to use a test string like `">&lt;i>xss test - pagename - fieldname&lt;/i>&lt;q z="` where `pagename` and `fieldname` are the page and parameter you’re testing. If you ever see that string in italics in the site, you immediately know that there’s XSS and where the input came from.

##### CORS

A related topic to XSS is vulnerabilities related to cross-origin resource sharing. You may have wondered why JavaScript running on one site can’t interact with another site that a user has open in their browser (say, in another browser window, tab, or even in an iframe). The reason is that all JavaScript in the browser is associated with an _[origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#Origin_determination_rules)_, which approximately is the same thing as a website. JavaScript on one origin can’t interact with web pages or data on another origin.

There are exceptions to this. The most common of these is called [cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS), and it allows a site to allow other sites’ JavaScript to interact with the site. Some examples of this are very useful, for example allowing JavaScript on [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) to interact with api.example.com. Improperly configuring CORS may have the unfortunate effect of allowing attackers to bypass some of the site’s security controls. CORS-related vulnerabilities aren’t data validation vulnerabilities, but it makes sense to learn about them after learning about XSS.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy CORS topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors) and complete the reading and labs.

#### SQL Injection

SQL Injection (often shortened to SQLi) has the properties of being relatively common in web applications, and also typically resulting in a complete compromise of the application and its data. While it is a little trickier to find and exploit than XSS, there are a few techniques that make identifying and demonstrating exploitability fairly reliable. Given its importance, this is the next vulnerability class we’ll be focusing on.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy SQLi topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) and complete the reading and labs.

Once you’ve completed the labs, here are a few tips for safely and reliably identifying SQLi.

##### Testing string parameters

A common way to test for SQLi is to go through a site adding `' or 1=1;--` to the ends of parameters. This is suboptimal for a number of reasons. The first is update statements. Consider the following SQL:

```
update users set password='Password1!' where username='alice'
```

What happens if, for the username, you pass `alice' or 1=1;--` instead of `alice'`?

```
update users set password='Password1!' where username='alice' or 1=1;--'
```

Oh no! Now every user in the database has the same password. You can never know (unless you’ve _very_ carefully reviewed the source code) where your inputs are going to go, so using <code><em>or</em></code> statements when trying to find SQLi can be quite dangerous.

Even if you don’t overwrite the database with this testing string, it can have other problems. Consider a multi-line query:

```
select *
  from comments
 where username = 'alice'
   and draft=0
```

When you pass in a username parameter of `alice' or 1=1;--`, the resulting query will be:

```
select *
  from comments
 where username = 'alice' or 1=1;--'
   and draft=0
```

Note the pesky semicolon in there. It causes the database to interpret the query as first a select query (<code><em>select</em> <em>\*</em> <em>from</em> comments <em>where</em> username <em>=</em> 'alice' <em>or</em> 1<em>=</em>1;</code>), and then an <code><em>and</em></code> query (<code><em>and</em> draft<em>=</em>0</code>). The problem with this is that there is no such thing as an and query, so this will result in an error. It might result in an error for other reasons as well, depending on the database. If the web application gives the same response for a database error as it does for no data (it should), then you won’t know that there is SQLi in the username parameter.

The proper thing to do when testing for SQLi in a string parameter is to make a test parameter that works regardless of the query it’s in. The best thing to do is to use two requests, one that will result in the original data being returned from the query and another that will result in no data from the query. You can then compare the three responses (original, test 1, and test 2). If the original and test 1 return the same response, and test 2 returns a different response, then you’ve identified SQLi. Here is a set of strings you can use:

For test 1, append the following to the parameter: `' and 'a' like '%a`

For test 2, append the following to the parameter: `' and 'a' like '%b`

Here are some example queries with these parameters:

```
select * from comments where username = 'alice' and 'a' like '%a'
select * from comments where username = 'alice' and 'a' like '%b'
```

Note that the first query will return the same results as if alice was passed as the parameter, and the second will return no rows. Thus there’s no risk of disaster if there's an injectable update or delete statement. Also note that the structure of the query is minimally perturbed, the tests will work even in multi-line queries.

You may be wondering why the examples use the <code><em>like</em></code> operation instead of <code><em>=</em></code>. That’s because the query you’re injecting into may use the like operation. Consider a document search query:

```
select * from documents where title like '%user text%'
```

The like operation allows wildcard operators, usually the percent sign. The above query will match any documents that contain the string “user text” anywhere in their title; the start, middle, or end. If we just used something like `' and 'a'='a` in our injection, then the test 1 query would be:

```
select * from documents where title like '%user text' and 'a'='a%'
```

This will return no rows, since “a” is never _equal to_ “a%”. If we use test 1 above, though, the query would be:

```
select * from documents where title like '%user text' and 'a' like 'a%'
```

Although they are not equal, “a” is _like_ “a%”. Thus, the above test 1 and test 2 should work in almost any string-based situation. Note that if you are testing a search feature, you might also want to try an additional test 1 string: `%' and 'a' like '%a`. Note that in the above queries the original search is slightly changed; it’s missing the % after the user text. If you suspect a like operation is in use, this test 1 string should make up for that.

##### Testing numeric parameters

Sometimes, when the browser passes a numeric value to the web server, the server includes it in a SQL query as a string. However, sometimes, it’s included as a numeric value. Typically, the SQL for a simple lookup of a numeric parameter will be something like:

```
select * from stories where story_id=5
```

Obviously, sending a story_id of `5' and '1' like '1` isn’t going to work, due to a syntax error. Instead, try sending two requests, one with a story_id of `5`, and another with a story_id of `6-1`. If the second one gives no result, an error, or a different story than the request with a story_id of 5, then there’s no evidence of SQLi. However, if passing a story_id of 6-1 results in the same response as a story_id of 5, then that is strong evidence of SQLi. The query is likely to look like:

```
select * from stories where story_id=6-1
```

In this example, the database engine is evaluating 6-1 as code, and retrieving the story whose ID is 5. From there, you can proceed to exploitation.

Of course, you can never know exactly what an application is doing to your input, or how it’s being used, but the above tips should significantly enhance the safety and effectiveness of your SQLi hunting.

#### Path Traversal

Path traversal typically occurs in websites that manage user supplied files or administrative interfaces, but can occur anywhere that the server-side web application itself opens files. Depending on what the server does with the files in question, the impact can range from source code disclosure at one extreme, to complete web server takeover on the other. Among modern web applications, the most common places to find path traversal vulnerabilities are blogging software and other content management systems, putting independent journalists and small media organizations particularly at risk.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy path traversal topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) and complete the reading and labs.

#### Command Injection

Although command injection is relatively uncommon in modern web applications, it almost universally resultist in a complete compromise of the web application in the event that it is found and exploited. Where it does appear, it’s usually in management interfaces and, to a lesser extent, in content management systems.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy command injection topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection) and complete the reading and labs.

#### Server-side request forgery

The general idea behind server-side request forgery (usually abbreviated as SSRF) is that an attacker can cause the web application’s server to send a HTTP request to any other server. Sometimes the application can display the response back to the client. For years, server side request forgery was considered a rather uninteresting vulnerability. When it was found, it was difficult to exploit in any sort of meaningful way. However, with the advent of cloud computing SSRF has suddenly become a critical issue.

In cloud environments, administrators can assign permissions to virtual servers themselves. This is typically used to grant access to data storage buckets, databases, network services, etc. Usually the resources in question are accessible over the internet, making the server permissions the only access control.

The way these server permissions (sometimes called instance identity, machine keys, service account keys, managed identities, etc.) work is actually quite simple. In a cloud environment, servers are virtual machines running on physical hardware. There is a web service running on the physical server that only accepts network connections from VMs running on the server itself. When it receives a request, it looks up the VM by IP address and retrieves information about the VM, including the customer and permissions role associated with the VM. It then generates cloud credentials for that role and sends them back in the response. Software on the VM can then use those credentials to authenticate to other cloud services.

If an attacker can cause a web application hosted in the cloud to send arbitrary HTTP requests and return the responses, then frequently the attacker can see the server’s cloud instances. If that happens, the attacker can impersonate the web server. One example of this is [the 2019 breach of Capital One](https://blog.appsecco.com/an-ssrf-privileged-aws-keys-and-the-capital-one-breach-4c3c2cded3af), which resulted in the compromise of sensitive information for over 100 million people.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy SSRF topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf) and complete the reading and labs.

#### NoSQL injection

Traditionally, web applications used SQL databases to store and retrieve their data. For many web application uses, developers have come to prefer NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, though there are many). These NoSQL databases use a different query syntax than SQL (not surprising, given the name), but the general concepts for NoSQL injection are similar to that of SQL injection. However, the specifics are quite different.

Head over to the [PortSwigger Academy NoSQL injection topic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/nosql-injection) and complete the reading and labs.

#### XXE injection

XXE injection uses the ability of XML files to refer to other files. Applications that allow users to control XML data that the application processes may be vulnerable. Exploitation typically allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the web server, and may also allow denial of service attacks and, in rare cases, remote code execution. Fortunately for defenders, most web applications do not process user-controllable XML.
