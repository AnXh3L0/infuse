## Use Case

If a website is hacked, understanding the actions and methods of the attacker is vital. At the very least, the site owners need to identify how the site was initially compromised so that they can fix any vulnerabilities that enabled that. It may also be important to know what data the attackers may have accessed or modified. This learning path describes some practices to help investigate and recover from a website hacking incident.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, the practitioner should be able to do the following:

- Identify the point of initial compromise of a website
- Identify the actions an attacker took after initial compromise

## Main Section
### Identifying a hacking incident

For most victims of a hacking incident, the delay between the initial compromise and detection can be months or even years. Compromise is often detected by an engineer thinking that something “seems odd.” Some signs of compromise can include:

- Changes to site content. These can range from subtle (e.g., invisible changes to JavaScript) to very unsubtle (defacement)).
- User accounts appearing in password databases or other data dumps
- Unexplained files on the web server
- Unusual network traffic in or out of web or other servers
- Small spikes in traffic, associated with odd requests in the access or error logs

When signs of potential compromise occur, it’s quite natural to want to explain them away. Nobody wants to face the prospect that their website has been hacked. To be fair, most websites are never broken into, so there likely is a perfectly reasonable explanation. However, it’s important to detect and investigate a compromise as quickly as possible.

### Moving from an IoC to initial compromise

Once you have established that the site has been hacked through one or more IoCs (indicators of compromise), the next step is to work backwards to find the source of the initial compromise. This serves two purposes:

- It identifies what vulnerability enabled the attacker to compromise the site, allowing the site owner to fix the vulnerability before restoring the site.
- Once an initial compromise is found, you can work to find the activities performed by the attacker.

It’s not always the case that a website compromise starts with a vulnerability in the website itself. While this may be the most common way in, you shouldn’t disqualify something like a [compromised developer account](https://www.qurium.org/alerts/targeted-sophisticated-phishing-attacks-against-dissidents-in-azerbaijan-is-trending/) allowing an attacker to simply upload a backdoor, or a [backdoored dependency](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/) being used as part of a supply chain attack.

Working backwards from an IoC to the previous step in the attack chain is a matter of connecting data and metadata from the IoC to the source of the IoC. For example, if there’s an unexpected file on the web server, when was the file created? What account created the file (e.g. the deployment system, the web server itself, a developer’s account)? If the web server created the file, check the access logs for requests around and just before that time. If a developer’s account created the file, check the SSH and other remote access logs around and just before that file’s creation time. If the deployment system created the file, check to see if the file was added to the source code repository. For each of these cases, if you find something, it may give you another IoC to work back from. Perhaps you find something in the web logs; are there prior requests from that IP address or netblock with that user-agent? If a malicious file was added to source control, what account added it, and from where did they authenticate?

Bear in mind that even minimally-competent attackers will usually make an attempt to cover their tracks. Some techniques they may user include:

- Connecting from different IP addresses and using different user-agent strings
- Uploading an initial backdoor, then using that backdoor to download a different backdoor, and finally deleting the first backdoor
- Deleting any log files that they find on the server
- Slowing down their hacking tools (e.g. [sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org/)) so as not to cause a big traffic spike

For these and other reasons you may not be able to create a clear set of steps from an IoC to an initial compromise. In some cases (like finding a data dump of the site on the dark web), you may have very little to go on. Note that when reviewing logs, it’s ideal if the web site uses a central, high-security logging platform, as hopefully the attacker has not been able to modify or delete those logs. Logs that are sitting on a compromised host may not be fully reliable. Another pitfall is log timestamps that are not aligned. Different systems may use different time zones, or may have inaccurate system clocks. When comparing timestamps across different systems, it’s useful to try to find logs for a single event, and then use that to find the offset between timestamps.

If, due to missing on uninformative IoCs, you do need to try open-ended searching of web server logs. The main issue with this is that web server access logs don’t give much insight into the results of those requests. If the site owners have set up customer security logging, obviously that may be much more helpful. If you do have to search through server access logs, here are some pointers:

- Consider parsing the logs and storing them in a more structured format for easier searching
- Attackers will often try to hide their attacks through encoding, so quickly look through the logs for percent signs (%) to see if there’s URL encoded data.
- Look for strings associated with attack patterns. Note that automated vulnerability scanners are constantly indiscriminately the entire internet, so you should expect a lot of results. If you have a lot of results, try to find patterns among them. Patterns that appear constantly throughout the logs are probably less interesting. Most interesting are groups of different patterns that share an IP address, netblock and/or user-agent. This is indicative of a human poking at the site. Some useful patterns to look for:
  - Requests with angle brackets (&lt; and >), especially the string `&lt;script`.
  - Requests with JavaScript selectors like `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, etc.
  - Requests with the string `../` in them.
  - Requests with single quotes and/or SQL keywords (`select`, `and`, or `where`, `update`, `delete`) in them
  - Requests that generate an unusually large response for their endpoint. (For example,. an article index usually generates a 30k web page generating a 300k page.)

If you find an interesting log entry that may indicate a source of compromise or exploitation, a quick way to check it is to try to send a similar request yourself. Completing the Web Application Security Assessment learning path will help you understand these attacks. Another approach is to work with the site owner to go through the code that processes that request and see if it could trigger a vulnerability in the code.

Through a mix of less-directing searching through logs and trying to connect the links of an attack chain, hopefully you can find the initial source of a compromise. Note that most attackers do not go through great lengths to hide their tracks. It’s a good strategy to start out looking for the most obvious thing first, and only after that fails to look for clever evasion techniques. For instance, if you find HTTP requests from the attacker, looking for more requests from the same IP address and/or the same user-agent is likely to be successful.

### Tracking an attacker forward

Once you have found the initial compromise, the next obvious step is to follow the attacker forward to see what they’ve done. The goals of this process are to determine what information the attacker has likely compromised and to prepare to evict them. The process of tracing the attacker’s steps forward is similar to, but easier than, tracing their steps backwards. Be sure to look for artifacts on disk and their metadata, in addition to logs. Comparing the files on the web server to what’s in the source code repository can be helpful with this. Also bear in mind that attackers will frequently attempt to expand their access to other servers, so maintain alert to attempts at horizontal movement. Finally, be sure to look for persistence mechanisms such as changes to cron files and the like.

### Evicting the attacker

Once you’re pretty sure what systems the attacker has access to (e.g., via exploits, backdoors, etc.), you can try to cut off their access. This is something you should try to do quickly and all at once. You’ll want to fix any vulnerabilities and remove any backdoors that you are aware of. Also note that most attackers, especially nation-state actors, work a regular schedule. Especially if the attacker doesn’t know that they’ve been detected, it’s best to evict them while they’re asleep.

The ideal way to evict the attacker is to tear down any servers that they might have accessed and rebuild them from scratch. This, of course, depends on having a clean version of the site source and reliable backups of site data (e.g., databases). If this isn’t possible, try to do as much rebuilding as possible, as opposed to trying to surgically remove the attacker’s access.

In the worst case, if the site’s infrastructure is completely overrun, or it looks as if the attacker is on the verge of getting a devastating level of access, it may be sensible to simply turn off the servers and replace the site with a static page.

### Recovering from the hack

If you believe the attacker has been evicted, you may be wrong. Even if the attacker has been evicted, they will likely be looking for another way in. It’s important to be actively looking for attacker activity. Additionally, if the attacker exploited a website vulnerability to get in, there are likely other exploitable vulnerabilities in the site. It’s a good idea to perform a security assessment on the site. See the Web Application Security Assessment learning path for more on this. It’s also probably a good idea to perform the site hardening processes described in Subtopic 1 of this learning path. Lastly, you probably identified some issues with the site, infrastructure, logging, etc. Now would be a good time to make a plan for addressing those issues.

If user data was compromised, the site owner may be legally and/or morally required to disclose the breach. Managing that is beyond the scope of this learning path, but [here’s an article to get started](https://discernibleinc.com/blog/-mailbag-reader-question-truthful-communication-legal-exposure).
