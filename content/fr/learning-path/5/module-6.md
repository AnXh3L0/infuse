## Use Case

Subtopic 5 is a prerequisite for this one, and learners are strongly encouraged to thoroughly read it before proceeding.

If you’re like most people, you struggled with the last practice. It probably took you a long time, and you probably missed a bunch of vulnerabilities. Don’t be dispirited! Before you started this, you would’ve found far fewer in far more time. It may not feel great, but it’s very difficult to transition from learning about vulnerabilities in isolation to finding them in an open-ended environment. So, struggling and not being super-successful is part of the process.

Once you’ve figured out the fundamentals of finding vulnerabilities in websites, this subtopic will teach you a process to find those vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, practitioners should be able to understand a methodical approach to web application security assessment that results in finding more vulnerabilities in less time.

---

There are a few common pitfalls that trap new web application testers. Think about whether you fell victim to any of these while testing Juice Shop:

- Hopping around through the site
- Focusing on finding particular vulnerabilities first, as opposed to fully testing certain sections
- Getting fixated on certain pages/input and spending a lot of time looking for phantom vulns
- Not reporting vulnerabilities as soon as they are found, and having to go back and re-test to document them
- Missing sections of the site and/or entire vulnerability classes

If you did any of these things, don’t feel bad. Most people struggle with these, often through full careers as professional web application testers. What you can do is develop strategies to avoid these (and other) issues that make your testing slow and unreliable. This subtopic will show you a few strategies to get you started.

## Strategy 1: Testing Process

In the last subtopic, we introduced the concept of a methodology for web applications security assessments,a way of organizing and thinking about testing. Now, we’re going to reframe that framework into a process. The problem with a framework is that it’s too general. You can test any web application using the framework, but for any specific application, you’ll be more successful if you give yourself more structure.

### Getting Started

When testing a website, you’ll usually want two users at each level of access, though this can vary. Consider an online forum. You’ll want two registered users, one or two moderators, and one or two admin users. This will let you fully test the site’s authorization controls. In the above example, things you might want to test include:

- Can users edit each others’ posts?
- Can users see each others’ private messages?
- Can users who are not admins or moderators perform moderation functions?
- Can users or moderators who are not admins perform administrative functions?

If you were testing a forum website that allowed multiple sub-forums, you might need 3 normal users (two assigned to sub-forum A and one from sub-forum B), two moderators and admins (one for each sub-forum) and a super-admin.

Once you’ve got the user accounts you need, you can start making a site map. The site map will guide your testing, and will function as your checklist for testing. As as example, you might produce something like this:

![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")

This shows every page you’ve found in the app (“URL” column), its logical navigation, whether the content of the page changes depending on its parameters (“User-specific?” column), and then whether each user type has access to the URL. There’s also a “notes” column for you to collect important info about the page, e.g., if the profile page shows very different content depending on the user of the person viewing the page or if data input on one page shows up on another. Some sites may not fit nicely into this particular structure. That’s fine, the structure should be specific to the site, so feel free to change it. However, something like this should work for most sites.

In building this spreadsheet, you need to go through all the pages on the site and all the site’s user roles. This is most of the Discovery section of the web methodology used in the previous subtopic. So, obviously, while you’re building the site map, you should make sure you complete all of the Discovery tests.

⚠️ This part of the process is extremely important, but can be very dull. To liven it up, do _a little_ ad-hoc testing while you’re going through the site. Maybe check an input for XSS here, do a little authorization check there. This will help keep you engaged while you go through the site.

### Per Site Testing

Certain parts of the methodology apply to the entire site, or a few places on the site. Every web server has a configuration, and most websites have 1 to a few logical servers (e.g. [www.example.com](http://www.example.com), api.example.com, static.example.com). Most sites have one (or maybe two) login/registration/account management sections and session management mechanisms. You should do these tests next. Doing so will let you feel productive by completing multiple methodology sections quickly, and will give you a chance to understand the structural underpinnings of the website. As you do these tests, you might find more web pages that you originally missed. If so, that’s fine, but be sure to add them to your spreadsheet!

Most people elect to keep their notes from these tests in a text file, as opposed to their testing spreadsheet, but do whatever feels natural to you.

### Per Page Testing

Now that you understand the site, you can dive into the biggest part of testing the site: testing every page (and every input) for the full battery of tests in the rest of the methodology. This is going to be a lot to keep track of, and if you don’t stay focused and keep track, you will miss things. Fortunately, you’ve prepared a spreadsheet. All you need to do is expand that spreadsheet and you’ve got a full checklist:

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")

This might seem daunting, but every cell in that sheet is a small, discrete chunk of work that should take a bounded amount of time. It’s usually more effective to go through the site filling out rows first; choose a page and go through the entire methodology, rather than performing one test throughout the entire site. As you go, put something like a “√” in cells as you complete them, or something like “n/a” if the tests don’t apply. Over the hours and days, your checklist will get filled in, and you can be confident that you’ve performed complete testing.

⚠️ It’s a good idea to keep separate notes in your regular notes document while you do this testing, you want to keep your spreadsheet clean and clear.

## Strategy 2: Time-box tests

Getting fixated on a particular page/input/etc while testing, and spending hours on it is a near-universal mistake among people who test web applications. They tell themselves that they’re at the cusp of a breakthrough, and they’ll be done in 10 minutes. Next thing they know, it’s two hours later and they forgot to eat lunch. (Not everyone does this. But if you do, you’re in good company.) If you have infinite time to test a site, then this isn’t much of a problem (missed meals notwithstanding). Most of the time, though, you have limited time. If you run out of time because you got fixated on one page, you may leave entire swaths of the site, riddled with vulnerabilities, untested.

If you find yourself getting stuck frequently, set a timer every time you start a cell in the testing spreadsheet. Make sure you can’t see the timer, looking at a clock countdown is stressful. With experience, you will be able to guess how long a cell should take. Give yourself a nice buffer (around 50% or more). So, if you think you can complete a cell in 10 minutes, set a timer for 15 or 20 minutes. The idea is for the timer to warn you that maybe you’re fixated, not to motivate you to go fast. If the timer goes off before you finish the cell, stop and evaluate. If you found a vulnerability and are making progress creating a demonstration exploit (e.g., you find SQL injection and you’re setting up something to extract the database), then reset the timer and keep going. If, however, you find that you’re chasing after some vulnerability that maybe doesn’t actually exist, then take a note about your progress to date, and move on to the next cell. If you have time at the end of testing, you’ll be able to come back.

This strategy also has good health benefits. The process of resetting the timer per cell also gives you an opportunity to get up and stretch, get a beverage, make sure you break for meals, etc.

## Strategy 3: Document as you go

This strategy was discussed in the previous section, but most people ignore the advice at first. Hopefully, in the process of completing the previous section, you either followed the advice, or you learned that writing the report at the end is not an effective strategy. Many people have to learn this lesson repeatedly through an entire career doing security testing, so don’t feel too bad if you mess up from time to time.

Related to this, you want to keep effective notes. Many people keep a running notes file that just includes everything they think of and odd things they notice during testing, and another notes file that includes further details about vulnerabilities that they find and conclusions about the site that are too verbose or unfined to the report.

These strategies should set you up for success in testing websites. We’ll put them into practice in the next subsection of this subtopic.

### Thinking of vulnerabilities through the lens of the OSI model

[The OSI](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking) (Open Systems Interconnection) Model serves as a standardized framework for understanding computer networking theory, although real-world networking is predominantly based on the more concise TCP/IP model. Nonetheless, the OSI model remains valuable for gaining an initial grasp of networking concepts. These layers collectively enable the smooth functioning of computer networks, ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission from the application to the physical hardware level.

Since the OSI model is one of the main ways in which we think about networking, it’s useful to be familiar with it when thinking of and looking for potential vulnerabilities as well.

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The OSI model comprises seven layers:

1. **Application**: Provides networking capabilities to computer programs, facilitating data transmission between applications. Data received at this layer is then passed down to the presentation layer.
2. **Presentation**: Receives data from the application layer, often in a format specific to the application. It standardizes the data format and handles tasks like encryption and compression before passing it to the session layer.
3. **Session**: Attempts to establish and maintain a connection with another computer across the network. It manages communication sessions and synchronizes data exchanges between the host and remote computers.
4. **Transport**: Selects the transmission protocol (TCP or UDP) and breaks down data into manageable segments or datagrams. TCP offers reliable, connection-based transmission, while UDP prioritizes speed.
5. **Network**: Determines the destination of the data transmission by utilizing logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) to identify the best route across the network. Commonly used logical addressing formats include IPV4.
6. **Data Link**: Focuses on physical addressing by adding the MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint to the transmission packet. It also ensures the integrity of data transmission and prepares data for transmission.
7. **Physical**: Handles the hardware-level aspects of data transfer, converting binary data into signals for transmission over the network. It is responsible for sending and receiving electrical pulses that constitute data transfer.

Attackers can breach each OSI model layer [due to inherent vulnerabilities](https://www.pynetlabs.com/various-kinds-of-osi-layer-attacks/). These vulnerabilities can arise from software bugs, design flaws, and misconfigurations, which collectively provide attackers with opportunities to exploit weaknesses across all seven layers.

- Application: Common attacks targeting this layer include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are injected into web applications to compromise user data or hijack sessions.
- Presentation: Attackers may target this layer with techniques such as format string attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms.
- Session: Session layer attacks include session hijacking, where an attacker intercepts and takes control of a user's session to gain unauthorized access.
- Transport: Transport layer attacks may involve TCP SYN flooding or UDP flood attacks, which overwhelm network resources by sending many connection requests.
- Network: Network layer attacks include IP spoofing, where attackers forge the source IP address of packets to bypass security measures or launch denial-of-service attacks.
- Data Link: Attacks targeting the data link layer may include MAC flooding or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing attacks, which disrupt network connectivity or facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Physical: Physical layer attacks involve physical tampering, such as cable tapping or signal interference, to disrupt network communication or intercept data.

## Practice

This practice is similar to that of the previous subsection, except this time you’ll be following the testing process outlined above. Also, the website you’ll be testing is a bit more realistic; it was built to be a website with vulnerabilities, as opposed to a site containing a bunch of challenges. As such, it should feel more like testing a real website does.

1. [Install DIWA](https://github.com/snsttr/diwa) (Docker is generally the easiest method)
2. Prepare your testing environment as with the previous subtopic. Make sure you have a blank report, one or more notes files and a testing spreadsheet. For the latter (and your future work), feel free to copy [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NPDA-CI5t_X0krw2qMwcOOupIWXhMCfYiTZFeyv-A08/edit#gid=0).
3. Start testing! Follow the process described in this subtopic, and compare how it feels to when you were testing Juice Shop. As before, the goal is to practice. Don’t look for answers or walkthroughs until you’re done.

## Skill Check

If you have a mentor, review your report with them. You will probably find it useful to look [at a list of the vulnerabilities present in DIWA](https://github.com/jeremiahblatz/diwa-answers/wiki/) available (please submit any additions). If you’ve found the majority of those in a reasonable amount of time (1-2 days), then congratulations!

If you don’t have a mentor, you can self-review using the list above.
